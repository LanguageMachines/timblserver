DescDetail: <<
TimblServer is a TiMBL wrapper; it adds server functionality to TiMBL.  It
allows TiMBL to run multiple experiments as a TCP server, optionally via HTTP.

The Tilburg Memory Based Learner, TiMBL, is a tool for Natural Language
Processing research, and for many other domains where classification tasks are
learned from examples.

TimblServer is a product of the ILK Research Group (Tilburg University, The
Netherlands) and the CLiPS Research Centre (University of Antwerp, Belgium).

If you do scientific research in NLP, TimblServer will likely be of use to you.
